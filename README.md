📌 About

This is my personal DevOps portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills, and hands-on experience.

🛠 Tech Stack

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Git & GitHub

GitHub Pages

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

The website is developed locally using VS Code

Changes are pushed to the main branch

GitHub Actions is triggered automatically on every push

HTML validation tests run before deployment

If tests pass, the site is deployed to GitHub Pages

🧪 Testing

HTML validation using HTML Tidy

The pipeline fails if HTML structure is incorrect

This prevents broken code from being deployed
